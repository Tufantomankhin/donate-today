            <h2>Who are affected by the Floods</h2>
            <p style="background-image: url('images/donation1.jpg');">Houses in flood-prone areas are under the water, surrounded by thick water. Many people have taken shelter on the roofs of their houses due to the flood waters. Water is also flowing over the roof of some houses. There is no way for the flood-hit people to go to safe havens, no food to survive, and not even clean drinking water for the people trapped in the flood waters. Help rescue flood victims, take them to shelters, and provide food and medical treatment.</p>
